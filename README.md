## A Bot That Texts You Daily Reminders For The Forgetful

This project was an idea turned personal product. I had met a Data Analyst at a coffee shop who created a python script that runs every morning and texts them a weather report to start the day.
This inspired me to create my own automated texting program. Ironically around the same time it was my close friend's birthday and I had almost forgetten to text/call them regarding their birthday.
That is where the idea comes into play: create an automation program that runs daily and checks a list of friends/family and reminds me if it's a birthday or not.
This works as follows:

*Compare today's date to key-value pairs

*Request information from the Twilio API to access texting number

*If current date matches, generate a happy birthday text with the person's name

*If current date does not match, generate a no birthday text

This project helps me stay up to date regarding my loved ones' birthdays. I have a hard time using the IOS calender app or Google Calender.
Most reminder apps tend to get frustrating and I have a hard time sticking to one app for long term use.

Text messages are easier to read, catch my attention, and keep me engaged. After figuring out how to send myself a text message, I just needed to create an algorithm to check the date.
Every morning I wake up and check my phone for any missed messages from my sleep. Text messages are always the first thing I pay attention to.
Seeing a birthday reminder text is more likely to encourage me to call or text my friend to let them know I remember their birthday!

The only disadvantage is having to update the repository otherwise the event with stop running.
